![Running Clock](img/clock.png)

# My Awesome Project
Happy Sunday Github,

This afternoon I spent some time doing a tutorial on how to do build a CSS + JS Clock in Vanilla JavaScript. Which was really fun because I always saw that some sites had a animated clock that was running real time and always wanted to do them.


## How It's Made
This was a easy set up on the HTML side when we got to the CSS and had to style everything thats when the difficulty started to really happen. For the most part, I had trouble with getting the clock hands to start from the center.Which transform-origin at 100% fix that and had the hour, minute and second hand being centered in the clock.




## Sample Tests:



## Lessons Learned:

How to properly use .sort(), .length, functions, modules, ascending sort method.
