![Running Clock](img/clock.png)

# My Awesome Project
Happy Sunday Github,

This afternoon I spent some time doing a tutorial on how to do build a CSS + JS Clock in Vanilla JavaScript. Which was really fun because I always saw that some sites had an animated clock that was running real-time and always wanted to do them.


## How It's Made
This was an easy set up on the HTML side when we got to the CSS and had to style everything that's when the difficulty started to really happen. For the most part, I had trouble with getting the clock hands to start from the center.Which transform-origin at 100% fix that and had the hour, minute and second hand being centered on the clock.

I also had to create a function and as well, called setDate() and made a const variable for seconds, minutes and hours rotate the div hands we created for each and got caught up at first with the seconds because when I got the hand to work it was off on the timing, It was already had a default offset 90 degrees and I had to do this for every other hand as well.

I also put more style by putting a video background, that autoplay and loop as well!


## Lessons Learned:

How to properly use transform, rotate(deg), transition, as well as using property transform-origin.

Going hard on the learning for J-query really thru me off when I came back to Vanilla JavaScript but it did allow me to remember a lot of the methods that are available.
